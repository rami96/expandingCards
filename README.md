# expandingCards
### Description
-This is a project where I tackle basic vanilla javascript and css animations and transitions to create a simple but beautiful image/card show.  
-It contains five of my most favorite sports.
### Things I learned doing this project:
-Filtering through nodes.  
-Learned more about media queries.  
-Assigning new classes and removing them with Javascript...
